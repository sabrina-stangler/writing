1. When your therapist says to "feel your feelings" they literally mean to feel physical sensations that accompany your emotions like chest tightness, light-headedness, etc.
  * Why this was relevant to me: I do a lot of feeling dismissal, feeling shame for feeling feelings, and thinking about/analyzing my feelings rather than _acknowledging_ them and _feeling_ them
