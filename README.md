# writing

This repository will serve as a hub for writings + musings that I want to both collect in one place and make publically available to share or be browsed.

## Blog Website

I made a blog website to show the ones that _feel_ like articles/blogs to be browsed a little more beautifully.

Made with GatsbyJS template, s/o GatsbyJS + Gatsby Cloud.
