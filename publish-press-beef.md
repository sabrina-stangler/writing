The Publish Press is a bit problematic ...

They try to take the stance of being neutral towards creator's endeavors, but their choice to include or omit stories in the first place disrupts this "lack of bias" too.

Issues
* They only highlight a few stories
* They focus on clickbait-worthy taglines and story headers
* Large creators are always covered (i.e. Logan Paul, Ludwig, etc.)
* Small creators are a bit neglected
* In taking a neutral stance, they often fail to convey the impact of creator's decisions, especially as they affect things outside of the content realm: i.e. NFTs affecting the environment

I would like this to be better. I really liked it for a while, and now I find it uninteresting or infuriating to read.
