In this brief article, I'll answer the question "Why write articles?" through the lens of impostor syndrome, the 1% rule of the internet, and representative media. 

Alternative titles I explored for this included "Why am I qualified to write articles?" or "What makes me think I'm so special?". My default instinct was to tell myself that I don't have a unique enough perspective or set of ideas to warrant adding to the pile of online content. While I'm sure my network would support me regardless, it is not a natural feeling to believe that I have something to add that is worthy of publishing. 

[The 1% rule of the internet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture)) describes the phenomenon that only 1% of people on the internet participate in content creation while the other 99% lurks, maybe 10% of lurkers engaging in liking/commenting on existing content. Putting this participation inequality into perspective leads me to believe that I'm not the only one who feels "unqualified" to create content. 

I feel comfortable assuming that the 1% of content creators does not accurately represent the content consumers. As my identity only dips into underrepresented groups [as a white cis woman], I'm inclined to believe dramatically less represented + intersectional identities are not so easily found. 

This is all to say, in a landscape dominated by people who look the same, it can't hurt to have a drop in the bucket making the space a smidge more inclusive. Further, while noticeable aspects of my identity will majorly influence the perception of the content I create, unseen aspects of my identity will still distinguish my perspective from other people who look like me. 

As a lasting thought, it's easy for me to assume readers will take my content in bad faith and write it off as "redundant" and "unnecessary". Even if it is, that doesn't mean it's not worth sharing. If every person saw every piece of content that has ever existed, this might be a different story; The reality is, however, that I might introduce readers to a concept for the first time, and _how cool that they get to hear about it from me_?
