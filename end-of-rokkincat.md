## Day 2

2022-11-02

We got the news on Monday - Nick & Jason told us as soon as they could. The last two days have been a whirlwind of emotions, as one might expect. 
I'm in the denial stage still, which has actually enabled me to think pretty positively about the opportunities resulting from this. 
For example, I'm really excited to try my hand at freelancing. I'm interested in being truly independent, and (hopefully) curating a working experience
that comes closer to what I really want to do as time goes on. Speaking of that, I've realized that I still need to figure out what I like doing.

Since the big drag with freelancing is that you also have to do all the sales work, I'm going to try my hand at creating content around software engineering
that will ideally resonate with potential clients. This feels like a super dub win win because I have really enjoyed making vlog content, and fwiw,
I really enjoy writing as well. I think it will be useful motivation to commit to a schedule and output more regularly in an efffort to sustain my business.
I mean shoot, maybe I even snag a few brand deals while I'm at it. That feels very possible at the same time feeling like it must be a joke.
I imagine I'll be able to snag a Bright Cellars sponsorship given that I was a customer for a few years, and they're a Milwaukee company and I'm a Milwaukee-based
_freelancer_ now. The Girls gotta support each other. 

A few of my soon-to-be-former teammates are talking about whether it makes sense to create an organization or infrastructure together to share the burden of 
sales, accounting, taxes, etc. I'm feeling a bit apprehensive because I want to be as independent as possible, but I also don't want to be foolish.
If I can take care of a future concern before it becomes one, that's great! That said, it's always been in my nature to need to make mistakes myself
to understand why solutions exist. It's quite an annoying trait, so I'd like to think I could consciously overcome it. That said, I just really want
the time space and freedom to be completely in control of my own finances. One would say it's my toxic trait - I think I can do anything myself. But once I 
realize how unpleasant it is or how incapable I am, I'm willing to pay for it. Now, however, my budget is going back to being very tight.

I'm going to get my last check on December 30th, 2022, then it's unemployment and/or registering my LLC. I wonder if I can do both, apply for unemployment 
benefits AND file a new company? Do those conflict with each other?

This is all to say, I'm excited about where the dust will settle, but I'm enjoying the blurry vision for now.
